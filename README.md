Metropolis (MacGyver's Personal Mod)
==========

Personal version of Metropolis skin for Kodi
This is my personal version of the Metropolis skin.

There is no support offered.

YOU MUST REBOOT YOUR Kodi INSTALL AFTER INSTALLING THIS SKIN!!
The first boot is going to set the skin settings to my settings whether you like them or not, 
so get that out of the way first.
After the first boot setting change you can set them to whatever you want and they will stay that way, 
but only after they have been set my way first.

Do not bother the real Metropolis Devs with issues you have with my version.

To use this skin, download the "skin.metropolis-personal-master.zip" by pressing the "Download Zip" button on the Git page (or use this URL https://github.com/MacGyverr/skin.metropolis-personal/archive/master.zip, then from inside a Helix version of Kodi, click Settings->Addons->Install From Zip File, point it to the downloaded file you got from the Git.

After selecting the skin, reboot your Kodi install.

(note that this method will not create the texture.XBT for the media images, (Git is not an ideal distribution method for a skin).
