Metropolis (MacGyver's Personal Mod)
==========

My older personal version of Metropolis skin for Kodi Helix.
This is my personal version of the Metropolis skin.  It has extra or future features not found in the official version.  Some of the extra features found here are pending for the next official release, so if you don't like messing with hard to install, non-auto-updating, simply waiting a little longer for the official version might be right for you.
Some of the things in this version are ugly (non-Metropolisian) in appearance and will never be in the official, but if it does what you want, this may be the only place you're going to find it. 

There is no support offered.

YOU MUST REBOOT YOUR Kodi INSTALL AFTER INSTALLING THIS SKIN!!

The first boot is going to set the skin settings to my settings whether you like them or not so get that out of the way first.

After the first boot setting change you can set them to whatever you want and they will stay that way, 
but only after they have been set my way first.

Do not bother the real Metropolis Devs with issues you have with my version!

To use this skin, download the "skin.metropolis-personal-master.zip" by pressing the "Download Zip" button on the Git page (or use this URL https://github.com/MacGyverr/skin.metropolis-personal/archive/master.zip, then from inside a Helix version of Kodi, click Settings->Addons->Install From Zip File, point it to the downloaded file you got from the Git.  (there is no need to rename or extract anything)

After selecting the skin, reboot your Kodi install.

This method will not create the texture.XBT for the media images, (Git is not an ideal distribution method for a skin).  So it's going to take up a little more space.


To update from an older version to the most current, simply change your current skin to something else, and download the newest version zip, then just install it like the normal steps above describe.  (click Settings->Addons->Install From Zip File, point it to the downloaded file you got from the Git.)
