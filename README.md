Metropolis (MacGyver's Personal Mod)
==========

My personal version of the Metropolis skin for Kodi 16 (Jarvis).  [This branch is a WIP for an Alpha version of Kodi, some commits will require a brand new Kodi 16 nightly release to work correctly again.]
This is my personal version of the Metropolis skin.  It has extra or future features not found in the official version.  Some of the extra features found here are pending for the next official release, so if you don't like messing with a hard to install, non-auto-updating skin, simply waiting a little longer for the official version might be right for you.
Some of the things in this version are ugly (non-Metropolisian) in appearance and will never be in the official version, but if it does what you want, this may be the only place you're going to find it. 

There is no support offered.  Do not bother the official Metropolis Devs with issues you have with my version!

YOU MUST REBOOT YOUR Kodi INSTALL AFTER INSTALLING THIS SKIN!!

The first time Kodi boots on this skin it is going to set the skin settings to my settings whether you like them or not so get that out of the way first.
My personal settings are as follows:
	AutoScroll
	AutoScrollFast
	ShowVideoPlotFullscreen
	Enable_OSDClearArt
	ViewPreferClearLogo
	WeatherIcons2
	MediaOverlay
	MusicSongInfoOverlay
	Home3 (horizontal menu)
	HomeStats
	HomeForecast
	DynamicWeather
	Show_PlotOutline
	Scrollbar
	NextAired
	UseExtendedWeather
	OneButtonSubtitles
	CaseOveralys
	CommandLabels
	Enable_OSDFade
	LibraryUpdated
	OSDFade,Complete
	OSDFadeTime,5
	DateFormat,DOW  (Day of Week)
	DefaultOSD,714 (one button subtitles)

After the first boot and the settings change you can set them to whatever you want and they will stay the way you set them, 
but only after they have been set my way first.

Do not bother the official Metropolis Devs with issues you have with my version!

To use this skin, download the "skin.metropolis-personal-master.zip" by pressing the "Download Zip" button on the Git page (or use this URL https://github.com/MacGyverr/skin.metropolis-personal/archive/master.zip, then from inside a Isengard version of Kodi, click Settings->Addons->Install From Zip File, point it to the downloaded file you got from the Git.  (there is no need to rename or extract anything)

After selecting the skin, reboot your Kodi install.

This method of installing a skin will not create the texture.XBT for the media images, (Git is not an ideal distribution method for a skin).  So it's going to take up a little more space.


To update from an older version to the most current, simply change your current skin to something else, and download the newest version zip, then just install it like the normal steps above describe.  (click Settings->Addons->Install From Zip File, point it to the downloaded file you got from the Git.)
