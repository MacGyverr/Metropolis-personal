Metropolis (MacGyver Helix MOD)
==========

Personal version of Metropolis skin for Kodi
This is my personal version of the Metropolis skin.

There is no support offered.

YOU MUST REBOOT YOUR Kodi INSTALL AFTER INSTALLING THIS SKIN!!
The first boot is going to set the skin settings to my settings whether you like them or not, 
so get that out of the way first.
After the first boot setting change you can set them to whatever you want and they will stay that way, 
but only after they have been set my way first.

Do not bother the real Metropolis Devs with issues you have with my version.

To use this skin extract the contents of the helix-custommenu-rewrite.zip, rename the helix-custommenu-rewrite folder to "skin.metropolis-kodi-fob", now put that folder and contents in your addons folder of your Kodi install.
This is located at C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Kodi\addons\  for installs a on Windows computer.

Reboot your Kodi, select the Metropolis (MacGyver Nightly Kodi Mod) version from the skin list.

(note that this method will not create XBTs for the images, and so themes will be broken unless you put the compiled XBTs for them in the themes folder yourself (Git is not an ideal distribution method for a skin).
